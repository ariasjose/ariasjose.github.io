I’m José Arias and I’m currently working as a developer/analyst
for a well-known company called Accenture within the newly
created [Search &amp; Content Analytics Group]("https://www.accenture.com/sca/") in Costa Rica after
[acquiring Search Technologies](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-acquires-search-technologies-to-expand-its-content-analytics-and-enterprise-search-capabilities.htm).

I also serve as a professor teaching the Programming Fundamentals
Course for students currently taking Bachelor’s Degree
in Informatics at the [ULACIT]("http://www.ulacit.ac.cr/").

This is a little description of me and what I do as one of
the intentions of this blog is to show some contributions
of the cool stuff I do every day.

I have more than six years of experience working on information
technologies related projects. I started working as a developer
in 2011 and since then I’ve been involved in different types
of projects using different technologies.
	
I’ve been part of cross-functional teams driven by different
methodologies like Kanban, Scrum, and Daikibo within Enterprise
environments and small customers.

Some of my roles during my career include software developer;
using different programming languages and technologies,
analyst of business requirements and given that I’m a certified
ScrumMaster by Scrum Alliance in some minimal especial
occasions a have played this role.

Last year (2017, in case you are reading this after 2018)
I started becoming passionate about big data related technologies
and topics, especially those used in data analysis.
That’s why I’m currently learning and developing my big
data technologies related skills and, I guess my first
achievement was to obtain the Spark certification from
[Cloudera]("https://www.cloudera.com/about/training/certification/cca-spark.html").

Hope you enjoy this little project with me.
