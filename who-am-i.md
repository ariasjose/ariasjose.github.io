I’m José Arias and I’m currently working as a developer/analyst for a well-known
company called Accenture within the newly created [Search & Content Analytics Group][accenture_ai] in
Costa Rica after [acquiring Search Technologies][st_adquisition]. I also serve as a professor
teaching the Programming Fundamentals Course for students currently taking Bachelor’s Degree
in Informatics at the [ULACIT][ulacit].

This is a little description of me and what I do as one of the intentions of this blog
is to show some contributions of the cool stuff I do every day.

I have more than six years of experience working on information technologies related projects.
I started working as a developer in 2011 and since then I’ve been involved in different types
of projects using different technologies.

I’ve been part of cross-functional teams driven by different methodologies like Kanban,
Scrum, and Daikibo within Enterprise environments and small customers.

Some of my roles during my career include software developer; using different programming
languages and technologies, analyst of business requirements and given that I’m a certified
ScrumMaster by Scrum Alliance in some minimal especial occasions a have played this role.

Last year (2017, in case you are reading this after 2018) I started becoming passionate about
big data related technologies and topics, especially those used in data analysis.
That’s why I’m currently learning and developing my big data technologies related skills and,
I guess my first achievement was to obtain the Spark certification from [Cloudera][cloudera].

Hope you enjoy this little project with me.
