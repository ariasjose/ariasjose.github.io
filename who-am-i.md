I’m José Arias and I’m currently working as a developer/analyst 
for a well-known company called Accenture within the newly 
created [Search & Content Analytics Group][accenture_ai]{:target="_blank"} 
in Costa Rica after [acquiring Search Technologies][st_adquisition]{:target="_blank"}. 
I also serve as a professor teaching the Programming Fundamentals 
Course for students currently taking Bachelor’s Degree
in Informatics at the [ULACIT][ulacit]{:target="_blank"}.

This is a little description of me and what I do as one of 
the intentions of this blog is to show some contributions 
of the cool stuff I do every day.

I have more than six years of experience working on information 
technologies related projects. I started working as a developer 
in 2011 and since then I’ve been involved in different types
of projects using different technologies.

I’ve been part of cross-functional teams driven by different 
methodologies like Kanban, Scrum, and Daikibo within Enterprise 
environments and small customers.

Some of my roles during my career include software developer; 
using different programming languages and technologies, 
analyst of business requirements and given that I’m a certified
ScrumMaster by Scrum Alliance in some minimal especial 
occasions a have played this role.

Last year (2017, in case you are reading this after 2018) 
I started becoming passionate about big data related technologies 
and topics, especially those used in data analysis.
That’s why I’m currently learning and developing my big 
data technologies related skills and, I guess my first 
achievement was to obtain the Spark certification from 
[Cloudera][cloudera]{:target="_blank"}.

Hope you enjoy this little project with me.
